# healthstats-collector

Health stats collector downloads health data from garmin connect website, turn them into prometheus metrics,
and push the metrics to prometheus pushgateway, which exposes a `/metrics` endpoint, and can be scraped by
prometheus.

Special thank you goes to [tcgoetz/GarminDB](https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB). The garmin connect scraper
in this repo was largely inspired by GarminDB.

Grafana dashboard built from those metrics:

## Getting started

Very cool! What do I need to generate a pretty dashboard like that??

Glad you asked, you will need:

- garmin connect account
- promethues
- pushgateway
- grafana
- docker
- docker-compose

You will need to rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill in the actual values.

To run this tool, you have two options:

- single run: `make`
- cron job: `make cron`

PROFIT!
